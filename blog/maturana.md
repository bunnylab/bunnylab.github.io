Back when I was in graduate school for cognitive science there was a lot of discussion among the faculty and 
graduate students about questions of interaction and identity. What brain regions interacted with which other
brain regions. What were the patterns of these interactions? Biologically speaking information from the eyes
did not just feed forward into the visual cortex and higher brain regions. Recurrent feedback circuits from higher
areas looped back and [affected more basic perceptions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion).
This opened a lot of  
interesting questions about what the most appropriate way to study something like perception or language was. 
Can you treat it as a sequence of interacting neural sub-units each implementing some function? Do you treat it 
as a physics problem, a computational problem, a formal logic problem? The particular department I was in had
some relative radicals who liked an approach that borrowed math and metaphors from dynamical systems in physics to 
describe mental states. Grad seminars often involved challenging an admittedly somewhat strawmanned concept of
Fodorian modularity and questioning where exactly the boundary of one's nervous system and identity lay. If 
you have a stick and tap around your environment and the stick relays vibrations back to your nervous system. 
Is the stick not meaningfully part of your perceptual aparatus? Fair question, but the one professor in particular
liked posing those kinds of questions a lot more than answering them so I wound up doing a lot of reading on my own.

One writer really stuck out to me. Humberto Maturana, a chilean biologist turned neuroscientist and 
philosopher. Maturana had developed a comprehensive theory about the nature of living and thinking systems. 
His contention was all living things were 'autopoetic' self-creating and maintaining with defined borders 
between the self and the broader world. Cognition in his words was 'the act of living' for these systems.
Interactions between the living system and perturbations from the world which the system had to respond to
to maintain homeostasis. Events in the world that did not disturb their homeostasis were not in the living 
systems 'domain of cognition'. Events that disrupted the systems homeostasis beyond the point of recovery 
were destructive. They changed the system into something that could no longer maintain itself autopoeticly.
A lysed cell for instance loses its membrane, the borders are necessary for its molecular machinery to maintain itself 
as a distinct entity and it dissolves into a soup of organic molecules. Its dead. For Maturana cognition
existed in the narrow band of inputs that had some effect on the systems structure but did not destroy it.
There's some solid sense to this. Humans don't perceive neutrinos, neutrinos don't generally interact with
normal matter and as our sensory systems are largely composed of normal matter there's no obvious physical 
way for a neutrino to trigger a neuron fire or any sort of response at all from us. Neutrinos are outside of 
our domain of cognition and it's only by hooking very sensitive devices up to outputs we can perceive that 
we know of their existence at all. It's a very mechanistic way of looking at life and cognition. The reactions
of the system to return it to equilibria are according to Maturana, entirely constituitive of the cognition,
the thought. Any system that is autopoetic and reacting to external disturbances to maintain itself is by
his definition, living and thinking. 

If you're skeptical you're probably starting to list off systems that could fit this definiton of living/thinking
that seem intuitively wrong. A rubber ball has defined borders and reacts to perturbations to maintain its internal 
state. So is throwing the ball at a wall making it think? Maturana would say yes. A ball thinks just not very much.
Maturana thought that living systems tended towards cognitive complexity because of selective pressures on their 
cogntive domains (the set of things they can interact with/perceive without destruction). A system could try to 
fortify itself against all possible present and future perturbations. Assume a physical structure where the 
perturbation is minimized and little or no reaction/thought is required. The other response is to become more
rather than less sensitive to the environment. To assume a structure where even the smallest changes in the 
environment produce a large reaction in the system which can hopefully then actively avoid destruction.
Maturana argued that this pressure to be more sensitive to the environment was the most important for living systems.
Particularly in border regions or times of change where the environment was less stable. Living systems he claimed were 
under intense selective pressure to expand their cognitive domain. For maturana that meant the systems were 
evolving physical means to be affected by the smallest possible disturbances in the environment and through 
some cascading reaction affect macroscopic responses in return. 

Interesting stuff, you could even take Maturana's ideas about autopoesis and cognition and apply them to social 
organizations or computer systems as well. In Maturana's theory these can also be cognitive systems and can be 
modeled as such. Maturana is still kind of a cult classic for cogsci and the cybernetics fields. You'll see him mentioned 
by some other interesting researchers like Beer (Randall not Stafford). Or sometimes in reference to his 
arguably cooler student Varela who lived in France and hung out with the Dalai Lama. But Maturana himself 
is not that well known, and that's too bad. He's one of the most original thinkers I came across in the field and
I think there's still a lot we could learn with his ideas.
